# 12c
A fixed grid CSS framework

To use, 
1. Wrap the page in a class div named container referenced in your stylesheet as .container
2. All columns add up to a 12 -- A 12 column grid
3. As an example, to define a grid that spans 4 columns, use the grid_4 class like so <div class="grid_4"></div>
4. Always add an extra class of 'alpha' when starting a new row like so <div class='grid_3 alpha'></div>
5. Enjoy
